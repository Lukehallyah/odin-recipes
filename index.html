    <!--Keep in mind that img files are "inline" and do not need an </img> ending.
    this means that in order for them to be part of a 'box' they have to "flow" the
    only ending should be the </div> at the end-->


<!--By putting the images in a div, what I've done is make a "container"for them so that css
can now influence-->

        Memories are an amazing thing, bringing us into the sweet embrace of childhood
        and thoughts of home and family. The smells, the sounds, the taste of an amazing 
        home cooked meal brings joy to the heart and soul, renewing the spirit! In Odin's 
        Recipes, we hope to bring to mind the feeling of family, the loveliness of a warm
        Meatloaf on a winter's evening, the wafting scents of hickory and honey of a smoked
        ham, and the sizzling sounds of Porkchops on a lazy spring day. Whatever you're looking
        for, Odin's recipes has it all, and you can even find out how to make it for yourself!
