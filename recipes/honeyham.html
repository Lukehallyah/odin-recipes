        <img src="../images/honeyham.jpeg">

        <h3>Smoked with Hickory and Honey</h3>
        
        <p>Many years ago, bored with cooking in general and looking
            for a new low cost hobby, my old man decided to try smoking
            a ham one day. He purchased a smoker and decided that Hickory
            really was the way to go adding honey as a sweetener knowing
            that hickory can be earthy and bitter. That first attempt those
            many years ago lead to a renaissance of flavor and it was the most 
            amazing ham my brother, sister, and I had ever eaten</p>
        </p>Easy to make and to prepare as long as you have a smoker, this
            recipe drips with flavor and power, both sweet and also somehow
            bitter, both dry in some places and uncompromisingly moist in others,
            this ham recipe is the perfect complement to any Christmas, Easter,
            or Thanksgiving meal and is sure to cause family stories for 
            many years to come</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Spiral Cut Ham, or Normal Ham</li>
                <li>Real Honey, mixes with water</li>
                <li>Hickory Pellets, Chips, or Wood</li>
                <li>Charcoal</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3> Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Prepare your smoker and add the Charcoal,
                        lighting it and waiting until the edges 
                        of the charcoal turn white, this is to ensure
                        the perfect temperature</li>
                    <li>Once the smoker is prepared, unwrap the Ham
                        and lay into a flat pan or bowl, taking the honey
                        and applying liberally all over the ham and into
                        the meat, its important to make sure the ham is 
                        completely covered to ensure proper flavor</li>
                    <li>The smoker should be giving off heat now. Add your hickory
                        and wait until the smoke becomes white, this ensures
                        that the wood is smoking properly</li>
                    <li>Finally add the Ham being careful to avoid the hot areas
                        of the smoker and allow to smoke until the meat on the outside
                        is dark brown but not burnt, there should be a glaze that appears
                        full of flavor</li>
                    <li>Finally, being careful to avoid the heat and wearing gloves
                        if necessary, remove the ham and place into a clean and sanitized
                        dish allowing it to cool. Your ham is now ready to eat and enjoy!</li>
                </ol>
