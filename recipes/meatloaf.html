            <li>2 pounds of ground chuck</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 cup dry breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of yellow mustard</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of worchestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of ketchup</li>
            <li> 2 teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li> 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>For the topping: 1/2 cup ketchup</li>
            
            
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 F</li>
            <li>Combine all of the ingredients into a bowl except
                for the milk and mix thoroughly. Also leave the topping
                ketchup for later. Finally mix in the milk as a last step,
                everything should be pretty sticky</li>
            <li>Form the meatloaf in a small pan ensuring to pick one 
                that has sides, making a small rectangular meat patty
                and finally covering the top with the topping ketchup</li>
            <li>Bake until an internal temperature of 160 F which should take
                approximately an hour and a half. The meatloaf should be allowed
                to rest for 10 minutes or so and cool before serving</li>
